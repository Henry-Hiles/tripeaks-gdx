An open-source tri peaks solitaire game with multiple layout options. Currently only has randomly generated games.

Changes: 

- Version 1.1 added new effects and option to use different card back designs.

- Version 1.1 also changes how the game state is persisted. This change should solve issues related to reloading the previous state, such as statistics getting wiped.
